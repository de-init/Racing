# Turismo Racing

Hi. This is my first Swift project. It is made on basic tools of UIKit. For the animations used UIViewPropertyAnimator & UIViewAnimate. For the autolayout was used framework - SnapKit. The project is built on the MVC pattern. A few screenshots of the game are attached below. *The game has a lot of bugs and flaws
